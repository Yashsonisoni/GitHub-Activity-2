### About Android Studio.

Android Studio is Android's official IDE. It is purpose built for Android to accelerate your development and help you build the highest-quality apps for every Android device.

It offer tools custom-tailored for Android developers, including rich code editing, debugging, testing, and profiling tools.

### Code and Iterate Faster Than Ever

Based on Intellij IDEA, Android Studio provides the fastest possible turnaround on your coding and running workflow.

## Instant Run

Android Studio's Instant Run feature pushes code and resource changes to your running app. It intelligently understands the changes and often delivers them without restarting your app or rebuilding your APK, so you can see the effects immediately.

## Intelligent code editor

The code editor helps you write better code, work faster, and be more productive by offering advanced code completion, refactoring, and code analysis. As you type, Android Studio provides suggestions in a dropdown list. Simply press Tab to insert the code.

## Fast and feature-rich emulator

The Android Emulator installs and starts your apps faster than a real device and allows you to prototype and test your app on various Android device configurations: phones, tablets, Android Wear, and Android TV devices. You can also simulate a variety of hardware features such as GPS location, network latency, motion sensors, and multi-touch input.

### Configure Builds Without Limits

Android Studio's project structure and Gradle-based builds provide the flexibility you need to generate APKs for all device types.

## Robust and flexible build system

Android Studio offers build automation, dependency management, and customizable build configurations. You can configure your project to include local and hosted libraries, and define build variants that include different code and resources, and apply different code shrinking and app signing configurations.

## Designed for teams

Android Studio integrates with version control tools, such as GitHub and Subversion, so you can keep your team in sync with project and build changes. The open source Gradle build system allows you to tailor the build to your environment and run on a continuous integration server such as Jenkins.

## Optimized for all Android devices

Android Studio provides a unified environment where you can build apps for Android phones, tablets, Android Wear, Android TV, and Android Auto. Structured code modules allow you to divide your project into units of functionality that you can independently build, test, and debug.





### Code with Confidence

At every step, Android Studio helps ensure that you're creating the best code possible.

## Code templates and sample apps

Android Studio includes project and code templates that make it easy to add well-established patterns such as a navigation drawer and view pager. You can start with a code template or even right-click an API in the editor and select Find Sample Code to search for examples. Moreover, you can import fully functional apps from GitHub, right from the Create Project screen.

## Lintelligence

Android Studio provides a robust static analysis framework and includes over 280 different lint checks across the entirety of your app. Additionally, it provides several quick fixes that help you address issues in various categories, such as performance, security, and correctness, with a single click.

## Testing tools & frameworks

Android Studio provides extensive tools to help you test your Android apps with JUnit 4 and functional UI test frameworks. With Espresso Test Recorder, you can generate UI test code by recording your interactions with the app on a device or emulator. You can run your tests on a device, an emulator, a continuous integration environment, or in Firebase Test Lab.




### Create Rich and Connected Apps

Android Studio knows not all code is written in Java and not all code runs on the user's device.

## C++ and NDK support

Android Studio fully supports editing C/C++ project files so you can quickly build JNI components in your app. The IDE provides syntax highlighting and refactoring for C/C++, and an LLDB-based debugger that allows you to simultaneously debug your Java and C/C++ code. The build tools can also execute your CMake and ndk-build scripts without any modification and then add the shared objects to your APK.

## Firebase and Cloud integration

The Firebase Assistant helps you connect your app to Firebase and add services such as Analytics, Authentication, Notifications and more with step- by-step procedures right inside Android Studio. Built-in tools for Google Cloud Platform also help you integrate your Android app with services such as Google Cloud Endpoints and project modules specially-designed for Google App Engine.



### Eliminate Tiresome Tasks

Android Studio provides GUI tools that simplify the less interesting parts of app development

## Layout Editor

When working with XML layout files, Android Studio provides a drag-and-drop visual editor that makes it easier than ever to create a new layout. The Layout Editor was built in unison with the ConstraintLayout API, so you can quickly build a layout that adapts to different screen sizes by dragging views into place and then adding layout constraints with just a few clicks.

## APK Analyzer

You can use the APK Analyzer to easily inspect the contents of your APK. It reveals the size of each component so you can identify ways to reduce the overall APK size. It also allows you preview packaged assets, inspect the DEX files to troubleshoot multidex issues, and compare the differences between two APKs.

## Vector Asset Studio

Android Studio makes it easy to create a new image asset for every density size. With Vector Asset Studio, you can select from Google-provided material design icons or import an SVG or PSD file. Vector Asset Studio can also generate bitmap files for each screen density to support older versions of Android that don't support the Android vector drawable format.

## Translations Editor

The Translations Editor gives you a single view of all of your translated resources, making it easy to change or add translations, and to find missing translations without opening each version of the strings.xml file. It even provides a link to order translation services.
